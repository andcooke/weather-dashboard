Current weather and a 5 day forecast will appear

## Lessons Learned 
    - Learned more about inserting parameters into a function and calling that function.
    - Learned more about local storage and how to implement it.
    - Learned specifically about the span element in HTML that allows a user to append inline text.


## Improvement

    -The site needs front end work. Things are not spaced as I would like, but everything works as desired. 
    -Also, if a user types a city wrong, the site saves a button with the mistaken city and doesn't produce accurate weather results.
